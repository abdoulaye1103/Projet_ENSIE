# Projet_ENSIIE

*This repository contains the various academic projects that I carried out during my studies at the École Nationale Supérieure d'Informatique pour l'Industrie et l'Entreprise (ENSIIE).*


* Folder "BINOMIAL_10_SOUNI_SAKHO" (**R**) : Machine Learnig applied to the prediction of hurricane intensity (from a database of the NOOA).
The folder contains 3 .Rmd files. 
The files "Description_BDD.pdf" and "Description_methods_used.pdf" describe the problem posed in detail and the data egeneering and data science parts respectively.
The file "Presentation_Projet_MRR.pdf" contains the presentation slides of the project.


* Folder "Projet_MAD" (**R**) : The file names are self-explanatory.
